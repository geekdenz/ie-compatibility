Internet Explorer Compatibility View Popup

Use this to display a discrete but noticeable notification to the user that they shouldn't run your page in "Compatibility View". This has been an issue for us and I thought I could do generic script that tells the user about how to fix the problem if they are running Internet Explorer 9 or in Compatibility View mode. I cannot guarantee this will work for all scenarios but it seems to work fine for what I tried.

This doesn't depend on any 3rd party libraries and should work in all browsers. However I didn't test it in anything other than IE.

```html
<script src="ie-compatibility.js"></script>
